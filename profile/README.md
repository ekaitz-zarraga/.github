## Ekaitz Zarraga

I'm a [freelance](https://elenq.tech) Free Software developer and R&D Engineer.

If you want to learn more about the type of things I do, maybe Github is not
the best place, as most of what I write ends up in other platforms like
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ekaitz-zarraga) or [my own
server](https://git.elenq.tech).

My [blog](https://ekaitz.elenq.tech) is a better place if you want to know
about me and my technical and social skills.

### I'm moving out of Github

I don't like this platform. I never did. For long I just accepted it because I
had to use it in order to contribute with others. Also, there were no good
alternatives at the time. [**But now they are**](#alternatives). If you
maintain a Free Software project, please consider moving somewhere else.

I will continue to be here as long as I need it to contribute with others.

#### Alternatives

- Codeberg: <https://codeberg.org/>
- SourceHut: <https://sr.ht/>
