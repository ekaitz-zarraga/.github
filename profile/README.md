## Ekaitz Zarraga

I'm a [freelance](https://elenq.tech) Free Software developer and R&D Engineer.

If you want to learn more about the type of things I do, maybe Github is not
the best place, as most of what I write ends up in other platforms like
Codeberg or my own server.

My [blog](https://ekaitz.elenq.tech) is a better place if you want to know
about me and my technical and social skills.
